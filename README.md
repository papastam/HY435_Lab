# Summary
This repo contains our work during the Labs of the [HY435](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy435/) course (@CSD)

# Lab 1
During the first lab we measured the throughput between hosts and servers (with the iperf3 tool). We ran multiple scenarios wich can be found in the [assignment PDF](https://github.com/papastam/HY435_Lab/blob/master/Lab1/assignment1.pdf). We plotted the results and reported them in the [Lab1 report](https://github.com/papastam/HY435_Lab/blob/master/Lab1/HY435_Lab1_Report.pdf).

# Lab 2
In this lab we implemented the iperf3 tool in C copying the original iperf3 tool functionality. The code can be found inside the `src` directory. To compile the iperf tool run `make` in the `./Lab2` direcory.
The executable syntax is ```./mini_iperf <options> ```

# Lab 3
For the 3rd Lab we configured a network topology using static routes. The topology can be found in the [assignment PDF](https://github.com/papastam/HY435_Lab/blob/master/Lab3/hy435_assignment03.pdf). we reported our work and outputs in our [Lab3 report](https://github.com/papastam/HY435_Lab/blob/master/Lab3/turnin/Report_Lab3.pdf). The `./sessions` directory contains our saved configs on each lab session

# Lab 4
For the final Lab of the course we configured the 3rd Lab's topology using the ospf protocol. The areas topology can be found in the [assignment PDF](https://github.com/papastam/HY435_Lab/blob/master/Lab4/hy435_assignment04.pdf). We reported our configurations in our [Lab4 report](https://github.com/papastam/HY435_Lab/blob/master/Lab4/turnin/Report_Lab4.pdf).
